# RAFT Consensus Algorithm

RAFT is a consensus algorithm designed for managing replicated logs in distributed systems. It ensures consistency and fault tolerance across distributed nodes by electing a leader to manage replication and maintain system state.

## Key Features
- **Leader Election**: Automatically selects a node to serve as the leader, managing communication and replication.
- **Log Replication**: Ensures that each node maintains an identical log, guaranteeing consistent state across the system.
- **Safety and Consistency**: Guarantees that logs remain consistent and all committed entries are durable and identical across nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles node failures gracefully, enabling the system to remain operational even when individual nodes become unavailable.

## How it Works
- **Leader Election**: Nodes begin in a follower state. If followers receive no communication from a leader within a certain timeout, they become candidates and start an election process to select a new leader.
- **Log Replication**: Once a leader is elected, it handles incoming client requests by appending entries to its log and replicating these entries to follower nodes.
- **Commitment and Consistency**: Entries are committed and acknowledged only when the majority of nodes have successfully replicated them, ensuring consistency even after node failures.

## Implementation Details
- **Programming Language**: (Specify language, e.g., Go, Python)
- **Key Components**: Leader election, heartbeat mechanisms, log replication, and consistency checking.
